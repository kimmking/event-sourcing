1. Persistence of upstream events
2. Persistence of downstream events. Zero-or-many atomic downstream events per one upstream event.
3. Rebuilding state on start from downstream events, processing upstream events that have higher sourceIds than applied
   downstream events.
3. Exactly-once processing of upstream events on fault restore.
4. Replay starting from given source/sourceId until given stop condition persisting output to a separate downstream file.
